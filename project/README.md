No special requirements to run the project file. Everything is in the 
ky_voter_turnout_project Jupyter Notebook.

The purpose of this project is to analyze Kentucky voter turnout for the 
previous three general elections (2008, 2012, 2016) and look for correlations
between voter turnout and variables like household median income (by county)
and population density (by county). 

The voter turnout data was retrieved from the Commonwealth of Kentucky State 
Board of Elections website. The population density and median income figures
are from the US Census.

I combined the voting data for each election into one csv file and then merged
it with a separate csv file that had the income and population density 
information. I chose to utilize scatter plots to explore the relationship
between total voter turnout and  median income, as well as total voter turnout
with population density. I also ran the same plots for republican and 
democratic party turnout. I used bar graphs to visualize voter turnout for the
two major political parties in the previous three general elections.
